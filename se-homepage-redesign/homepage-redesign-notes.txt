HOMEPAGE REDESIGN

80% doesn't get past second screen
needs to be big promotional unit, more like cover of magazine
max 2 screens high

social media links/display? - instagram feed? twitter?
seasonal thing?
dashboard with latest and/or featured and/or most popular posts?
carousel?
for most popular ... time limit?

new users - informational
old users - what's new & popular

big image with two smaller on the side?
featured images smaller? take up a lot of real estate

mobile carousel?

what about sponsored posts that live on the homepage? if too high a percentage is sponsored ... overshadows other content

tags for specific slots on homepage? so most recent post with that tag will show in that spot?
