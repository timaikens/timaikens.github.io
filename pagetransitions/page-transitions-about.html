			<h1>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</h1>
			<p>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
			<p>Belligerent and numerous. The alien mothership is in orbit here. <strong> If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.</strong> <em> Checkmate.</em> Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
			<h2>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</h2>
			<p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Is that a cooking show?</li><li>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</li><li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</h3>
			<p>Really?! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Do a flip!</li><li>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</li><li>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
			<p>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
			<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Negative, bossy meat creature! I wish! It's a nickel. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
			<p>Yeah, lots of people did. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
			<p>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
			<p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
			<p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
			<p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Also Zoidberg. You lived before you met me?! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
			<p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
			<p>Also Zoidberg. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
			<p>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
