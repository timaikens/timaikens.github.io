			<h1>I'm partial to air conditioning.</h1>

			<h2>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</h2>
			<p>He taught me a code. To survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</p>

			<p>Tell him time is of the essence. You're a killer. I catch killers. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm really more an apartment person. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>

			<p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I am not a killer.</p>
			<p>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm generally confused most of the time. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
			<p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
			<p>I like seafood. He taught me a code. To survive. You're a killer. I catch killers. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
			<p>I'm really more an apartment person. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Only you could make those words cute. I have a dark side, too. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
			<p>Only you could make those words cute. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
			<p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look…perfect. I am not a killer.</p>
			<p>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Like a sloth. I can do that. He taught me a code. To survive. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.</p>
			<p>I have a dark side, too. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.</p>
			<p>Tell him time is of the essence. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You all right, Dexter? Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>
			<p>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm generally confused most of the time.</p>
